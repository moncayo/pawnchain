Chess is an art. Pawnchain mints ERC-721 tokens that represent a PGN (Portable Game Notation) and a corresponding GIF for famous games in chess history. The contracts are written in Solidity, tested and deployed with Truffle Suite. The GIFs are generated directly from the PGNs and uploaded to the IPFS, where the resulting hash is passed into the smart contract's token minting function.

Currently minted:
1. Deep Blue vs. Garry Kasparov, Game 1, 1996
2. Duke Karl II & Count Isouard vs. Paul Charles Morphy, 1858
3. Donald Byrne vs. Bobby Fischer, 1956
